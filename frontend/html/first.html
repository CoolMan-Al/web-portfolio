        <p>
            The browser thinks that &lt; is a programming character. Also &gt;.
            The browser also ignores any line breaks
        </p>

        <p>
            in your code and any white space. To include these you need to use special characters aka
            html character entities. There are other entitites available such as Â£ and &amp;

        <p>
            A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find.
            You can have links to separate sites such as
            <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/">Leeds Beckett</a>.

            Links to other pages of the
            <a href="https://libguides.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/archives">same site</a>.

            Links to another point in the
            <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/schoolsandcolleges/">same page</a>. <br>

            A link has been made to the second page of this section,
            <a href="second.html">the page where I tested html tags.</a>

            This image is stored on this server in an image subfolder
            <img src="images/first.webp" width="100" height="100" alt="A present icon.">
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope you added an alt attribute to support screenreaders
        </p>

        <p>
            Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using the
            W3C Markup Validation Service without the alt attribute included.
            If you right click on your page and chose inspect or view source you can
            check your code and see the HTML comment you have added inside the body tag
